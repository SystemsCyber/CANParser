At the time of writing this the wasm-bindgen-rayon crate requires the standard library to be recompiled using the unstable branch of rustc so that the sync features are compiled for threaded environments. But this leads to an unstable program that can't be compiled on stable rustc. So for now we have to ignore the wasm-bindgen-rayon crate. But these files are here to show that we have tried to use rayon to speed up the parsing process and that maybe in the future we can use it.
